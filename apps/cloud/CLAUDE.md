# apps/cloud — IoT Cloud Server

Multi-tenant IoT gateway platform. Runs on a cloud VM, manages N IoT
devices behind NAT via OpenVPN tunnels, serves as the single LwM2M
authority (Bootstrap + Device Management), reverse-proxies each
device's local UI, and serves the Cloud Operator Dashboard.

## Architecture

```
                    ┌──── lwm2m-bs (coaps://0.0.0.0:5684)
                    │
ds-server ── iot-cloudd ── iot-httpd (REST API + Cloud UI)
    │          │   │
    │          │   └──── lwm2m-dm (coaps://0.0.0.0:5683)
    │          │
    └──────────┴────── all IPC via /var/run/iot/data_store.sock
```

**Four binaries** (all in one image) → **five containers** at runtime:
- `ds-server` — shared data store (Lua-backed, schema-enforced)
- `iot-cloudd` — LwM2M BS/DM logic, VPN registry, endpoint provisioning
- `iot-httpd` — REST API (/api/v1/*) + serves Cloud UI (/webui/)
- `lwm2m` — **device binary reused in server role** for CoAP/DTLS transport;
  runs as two separate containers (`lwm2m-bs` on 5684, `lwm2m-dm` on 5683)

All daemons communicate exclusively through ds-server — no HTTP between
daemons. Same pattern as the device-side stack.

**Why reuse the device lwm2m binary?**  The device binary already has full
CoAP/UDP/DTLS support and handles `/bs` (bootstrap) and `/rd` (registration)
dispatch. Running it in `role=server` mode gives us the LwM2M CoAP endpoints
without writing a second CoAP stack. MongoDB linking is patched out (the
cloud doesn't need the device-side registration mirror).

**Daemon self-state:** Every daemon writes its own state to ds
immediately after connecting: iot-cloudd writes
`services.cloud.iot.cloudd.state` / `services.cloud.openvpn.server.state`,
iot-httpd writes `services.cloud.iot.httpd.state`, and the LwM2M CoAP
containers (lwm2m-bs, lwm2m-dm) run the lwm2m binary with `lwm2m-instance=bs|dm`
which self-reports `services.cloud.lwm2m.*.state` immediately after
connecting to ds. All state keys default to
`"stopped"` in the schema — the daemon self-reports `"running"` at startup
and `"exited"` at shutdown. The Services page polls these keys every 5s.

### Debug mode (developer aid)

A global **Debug** toggle sits at the bottom of the sidebar next to
**Dark** (in both cloud-ui and iot-ui). Like the theme toggle it is a
`providedIn:'root'` `DebugService` persisted per-browser in
`localStorage['iot-debug']` — no backend state.

When on, every config form input shows — just below it — the data-store
key that fills the field plus an **editable raw value box** bound straight
to that key, so an operator building their own app can discover and poke
the ds key/value behind any field. Implementation (in each UI's
`src/common/`):

- `debug.service.ts` — the on/off flag.
- `ds-debug.directive.ts` — `*dsDebug`, a structural directive that renders
  its content only while Debug is on (placed on `<clr-control-helper>` so
  the hint slots into Clarity's below-input region and keeps the 4-column
  `.form-grid` aligned).
- `ds-hint.component.ts` — `<app-ds-hint key="cloud.vpn.subnet">`, which
  self-reads/writes the raw value via `/api/v1/db`, admin-gated.

Wire a new field with one line — no component changes needed:
```html
<clr-control-helper *dsDebug><app-ds-hint key="cloud.vpn.subnet"></app-ds-hint></clr-control-helper>
```
Array/datagrid editors (no single key) and checkbox containers are not
wired.

## API patterns

All config pages use the same REST surface.  The UI always calls the
same-origin iot-httpd (no CORS):

| Operation | Method | Path | Payload |
|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| Read keys | POST | /api/v1/db/get | `{keys: ["a.b", ...]}` |
| Write keys | POST | /api/v1/db/set | `{pairs: [{key, value}, ...]}` |
| Long-poll | GET | /api/v1/db/get?key=k&timeout=N | query params |
| Login | POST | /api/v1/auth/login | `{id, password}` |
| Logout | POST | /api/v1/auth/logout | — |
| Status | GET | /api/v1/status?timeout=N | — |
| Cloud endpoints | GET | /api/v1/cloud/endpoints | — (ds-backed) |
| Log text | GET | /api/v1/log | — (text/plain) |

All `/api/v1/*` routes except `/api/v1/auth/*` require a session cookie.

## Naming convention

All ds keys use **dots only** — no hyphens, no underscores:
```
cloud.bs.psk.id          ✓
cloud.bs.psk_id          ✗ (underscore)
cloud.bs.psk-id          ✗ (hyphen)
services.cloud.iot.cloudd.enable   ✓
services.cloud.iot-cloudd.enable   ✗ (hyphen)
```

## Building

The cloud image builds four binaries from the same source tree:

| Binary | Source | Flags |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `ds-server`, `ds-cli` | `modules/data-store/` | — |
| `iot-httpd` | `modules/http-server/` | — |
| `iot-cloudd` | `apps/cloud/server/` | — |
| `lwm2m` | `apps/CMakeLists.txt` | `-DIOT_ENABLE_MONGO=OFF` |

The `lwm2m` binary is the **same** one built by `docker/Dockerfile` for
device images — only the `IOT_ENABLE_MONGO` flag differs (device = ON,
cloud = OFF).

```bash
# From repo root:
podman build -t naushada/iot-cloud:latest -f apps/cloud/Dockerfile .

# Or use run.sh:
cd apps/cloud && ./run.sh build
```

## Running

```bash
cd apps/cloud
./run.sh           # docker compose up -d (all 5 services)
./run.sh logs      # tail logs (ds-cli + service states)
./run.sh stop      # stop all
```

### Volume persistence and schema updates

`docker-compose.yml` uses named volumes so data survives container
restarts **and host reboots** (named volumes are on-disk under the runtime's
`volumes/` store; only an explicit `volume rm` destroys them):

| Volume | Mount point | Content |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `iot-etc` | `/etc/iot` | Schemas, config files |
| `iot-lib` | `/var/lib/iot` | Persisted data store (`data_store.lua`) |
| `iot-run` | `/var/run/iot` | Unix socket (tmpfs-like) |

The data store at **`/var/lib/iot/data_store.lua`** is write-through +
`fsync` on every `set`, so committed config/credentials persist across a
reboot. Host path: `$(docker volume inspect cloud_iot-lib --format '{{.Mountpoint}}')/data_store.lua`.
See `modules/data-store/docs/design.md` §4.4 for the full persistence/host-path
matrix.

**Important:** Named volumes are populated from the image only on
**first creation**. After a rebuild that changes schema files
(`services.lua`, `iot.lua`, etc.) or config files under `apps/config/`,
the old volume still has the old files. To pick up changes:

```bash
./run.sh stop
podman volume rm cloud_iot-etc   # or: docker volume rm cloud_iot-etc
./run.sh
```

The volume will be recreated with the latest image contents.
`iot-lib` (persisted data) and `iot-run` (socket) do not need to be
reset.

Service ports:
| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 80 | Cloud UI + REST API |
| 5683 | LwM2M DM (CoAPs) |
| 5684 | LwM2M Bootstrap (CoAPs) |
| 1194 | OpenVPN (UDP) |

## LwM2M CoAP Server

The device `lwm2m` binary (from `apps/CMakeLists.txt`) is built inside the
cloud image and run as two containers in `role=server` mode:

| Container | Port | Role | CoAP Endpoint |
|-----------|------|------|---------------|
| `lwm2m-bs` | 5684/udp | Bootstrap Server | `coaps://0.0.0.0:5684` |
| `lwm2m-dm` | 5683/udp | Device Management | `coaps://0.0.0.0:5683` |

**PSKs are never hardcoded.** Neither server registers a shared/default
identity or secret — there is no `LWM2M_PSK_ID/KEY` env or CLI arg in the
deployed compose. Each server authenticates a handshake against the
**per-endpoint credential** for the identity the client presents, looked up
**live from `cloud.endpoint.credentials`** by a ds-backed PSK resolver
(`DTLSAdapter::set_psk_resolver`, wired in `apps/src/main.cpp`):

- **BS** matches `sha256(serial)[:32] == presented-identity` → `bs.psk.key`
- **DM** matches `dm.psk.id == presented-identity` → `dm.psk.key`

The resolver runs on the handshake/reactor thread (not the ds listener
thread), so its blocking `get()` is safe; reading live means a device
provisioned *after* the server started authenticates with no restart, and ds
stays the single source of truth. The identity itself is always *derived from
the serial* (BS `sha256`, DM `rpi<serial>@cloud.local`), never stored. A
`identity=/secret=` CLI override still exists but only for the dev/interop
test harness — production passes nothing.

The device binary already handles `/bs` (bootstrap session) and `/rd`
(registration) dispatch over CoAP/UDP/DTLS. It is built from the same
`apps/CMakeLists.txt` as the device, with `-DIOT_ENABLE_MONGO=OFF` to
skip MongoDB linking (the cloud doesn't need the device-side registration
mirror).

**Device schemas and configs** (`net.lua`, `vpn.lua`, `wifi.lua`, and
`apps/config/`) are also copied into the cloud image at `/etc/iot/` so
the lwm2m binary finds the schema and provisioning data it expects.

## Device UI over VPN

Each registered device runs its own web UI behind NAT, reachable from the
operator only through the tunnel. The cloud exposes it via a per-device DNAT.

**Per-device mapping.** When a device registers it is assigned a VPN virtual
IP (`tun_ip`, e.g. `10.9.0.x`) and a proxy port (`proxy_port`, allocated by
`VpnRegistry`); both live in the `cloud.endpoints` ds JSON. Operator access is
`http://<cloud-host>:<proxy_port>/` — the Endpoints page **Launch UI** link —
which DNATs to the device's UI over the tunnel.

**nftables DNAT (`modules/server/dnat`).** `iot-cloudd` installs a per-device
DNAT for every endpoint that has both a `tun_ip` and a `proxy_port`:

```
tcp dport <proxy_port> dnat to <tun_ip>:<ui_port>     # prerouting (nat)
oifname "tun0" masquerade                              # postrouting (nat)
oifname/iifname "tun0" accept                          # forward (filter)
```

The whole ruleset lives in its own table `ip iot_cloud_dnat` so re-applying
flushes only our rules (never NetworkManager / docker / openvpn chains). It is
built (`build_device_dnat_ruleset`) from `cloud.endpoints` and applied with
`nft -f -` (`apply_ruleset`) at startup and on every provision / deprovision /
registration change — idempotent (full-table flush + rebuild). `iot-cloudd`
also enables IPv4 forwarding (`enable_ip_forward` → `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`)
once at startup.

**ds-driven proxy ports:**

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `cloud.proxy.device.ui.port` | `80` | the device's web-UI port (DNAT target port); seeded at startup |
| `cloud.vpn.proxy.port.start` | `10000` | low end of the proxy-port range `VpnRegistry` allocates from |
| `cloud.vpn.proxy.port.end` | `10050` | high end of the proxy-port range |

The range is read from ds at startup (CLI `proxy-start=`/`proxy-end=` are
fallbacks) and written back so it is visible/editable; changing
`cloud.proxy.device.ui.port` triggers a DNAT rebuild.

**Networking: bridge + published ports** (NOT host networking). `iot-cloudd`
runs on the default bridge and **publishes** `1194/tcp` + the proxy range
(`PROXY_START-PROXY_END`, default `10000-10050`) via docker-compose `ports:`.
Published ports bypass the host `ufw` (the `DOCKER-USER` chain), so they're
reachable without per-port ufw rules — host networking was tried and reverted
because it subjected `1194` to ufw (allow-22-only → connection refused). Notes:

- The proxy range is kept **small and above the CoAP ports** (5683/5684):
  each published port spawns a `docker-proxy` process, so a wide range (the
  old `5001-6000` = 1000 ports) exhausts the host. Widen `PROXY_START/END`
  for a bigger fleet, or switch to host networking (no per-port proxy).
- The **published** range (`ports:`, a deploy-time env knob Docker reads
  before ds exists) must cover the **ds** allocation range
  (`cloud.vpn.proxy.port.*`); `run.sh` defaults both to `10000-10050`.
- `iot-cloudd` has `NET_ADMIN` + `sysctls: net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` in compose
  to run the OpenVPN server tun + install the per-device DNAT.

The cloud also pushes the VPN *endpoint* (host/port/proto) down to the device
over LwM2M Object 2048 — see `apps/docs/lwm2m-object-handling.md` §2.8.

## Log Levels

Default is `INFO` for all daemons. Per-daemon keys override the global
`log.level`; an empty per-daemon value means "inherit global".

| Key | Scope |
|-----|-------|
| `log.level` | Global default (default `"INFO"`) |
| `log.level.cloudd` | iot-cloudd |
| `log.level.httpd` | iot-httpd |
| `log.level.lwm2m.bs` | lwm2m Bootstrap Server |
| `log.level.lwm2m.dm` | lwm2m Device Management |
| `log.level.vpn` | VPN server |
| `log.level.dtls` | DTLS stack |

Valid levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`.

Changes take effect immediately — each daemon watches its log level key
and hot-reloads via `ACE_Log_Msg::priority_mask()`.

### Enabling DEBUG at boot

On a cold first boot the schema default `"INFO"` wins. To start at DEBUG:

**Persist the value (survives restarts):**
```bash
ds-cli set log.level DEBUG
```
Once set via the cloud UI or ds-cli, the value is persisted to
`/var/lib/iot/data_store.lua` and loads before any daemon connects on
the next boot.

**Per-daemon at boot (before the daemon starts):**
```bash
ds-cli set log.level.cloudd DEBUG   # cloudd only
```

Daemons self-report their log output to ds so the cloud UI log viewer
can tail them live:

| Daemon | Log key |
|--------|---------|
| iot-httpd | `log.text` |
| iot-cloudd | `log.cloudd.text` |
| lwm2m (client) | `log.lwm2m.text` |
| lwm2m-bs | `log.lwm2m.bs.text` |
| lwm2m-dm | `log.lwm2m.dm.text` |

Each log line includes the daemon name for debugging: `... cloudd: ...`,
`... httpd: ...`, `... lwm2m: ...`.

## Auth

Session-auth via cookies (SHA-256 password hashing). Default: `admin/admin`.
Auth is enabled by default (`http.auth.enabled=true` in ds). Non-API paths
(/webui/*, /index.html, etc.) are public so the login page loads before auth.
All `/api/v1/*` routes except `/api/v1/auth/*` require a valid session.

Disable auth at runtime:
```bash
ds-cli set http.auth.enabled false
```

## Key data store paths

### HTTP Server (http.*) — reused from device schema
```
http.listen.ip           → Bind address (default "0.0.0.0")
http.listen.port         → Listen port (default 8080)
http.listen.scheme       → "http" | "https"
http.tls.cert            → TLS cert PEM path (required for https)
http.tls.key             → TLS key PEM path (required for https)
http.tls.ca              → CA bundle PEM path (optional — enables mTLS)
http.workers             → Handler thread pool (0 = inline, default). ds-ONLY:
                           no CLI arg / env — the compose used to pass
                           http-workers= which silently overrode this key, so
                           the UI showed 0 while the daemon ran 4. Now ds is
                           the single source of truth (set it in the HTTP page).
http.auth.enabled        → Auth gate (true = enabled, from auth.lua)
```
Hot-reloaded: all except `http.workers` (needs a restart).

### Bootstrap Server (cloud.bs.*)
```
cloud.bs.endpoint        → BS server identity (default: urn:dev:gateway-)
cloud.bs.uri             → BS CoAPs endpoint (default: coaps://0.0.0.0:5684)
cloud.bs.security.mode   → "PSK" | "None"
cloud.bs.psk.id          → BS PSK identity (RID 3)
cloud.bs.psk.key         → BS PSK secret (RID 5, opaque)
```

### Device Management (cloud.dm.*)
```
cloud.dm.uri             → DM server URI (pushed to devices, RID 0)
cloud.dm.lifetime        → Default registration lifetime (RID 1, default 86400)
cloud.dm.binding         → Default binding mode (RID 7, default "U")
cloud.dm.psk.id          → DM PSK identity (post-bootstrap)
cloud.dm.psk.key         → DM PSK key (post-bootstrap, opaque)
cloud.dm.lwm2m.version   → LwM2M version (default "1.1")
```

### Provision (per-device)
```
cloud.provision.request   → Endpoint name (serial) to provision (iot-cloudd watches)
cloud.deprovision.request → Endpoint name to deprovision (iot-cloudd watches)
```
Provisioning is driven from the cloud-ui **Endpoints** page via the PSK flow
below (serial + BS PSK → `cloud.endpoint.credentials`). The Security/Server
object TLVs pushed at `/bs` are built by the `lwm2m-bs` server from
`cloud.bs.*` / `cloud.dm.*` + the per-endpoint `cloud.endpoint.credentials`
(see below) — there is no per-endpoint `cloud.provision.configs` override.

### PSK provisioning (serial-derived endpoint + write-only PSK)

See `apps/docs/tdd-psk-provisioning.md`. Each device's serial is the LwM2M
endpoint and the on-the-wire BS DTLS PSK identity (raw serial). The cloud
owns the formatted identity `rpi<serial>@cloud.local`, which keys both the
BS and DM PSKs. The **BS PSK is generated in device-ui** (browser) and pasted
into the cloud Endpoints page; the **DM PSK is minted by iot-cloudd** per
endpoint. Provisioning is **db/set-driven** — no bespoke REST endpoint.

Flow: cloud-ui writes `cloud.provision.bs.psk` (carrier) then
`cloud.provision.request` = serial (the existing watched trigger);
iot-cloudd formats the identity, mints the DM PSK, upserts
`cloud.endpoint.credentials`, and clears the carrier.

```
cloud.provision.bs.psk    → Carrier: engineer-pasted BS PSK (64 hex).
                            Cleared by iot-cloudd after upsert. (gid:cloud-svc)
cloud.endpoint.credentials → JSON array, per-endpoint creds. The BS/DM
                            servers load this live (BS keys by raw serial,
                            DM by formatted identity). Write-only /
                            no ds-cli read. (gid:cloud-svc)
  [{
    "serial":     "100000abcd",
    "identity":   "rpi100000abcd@cloud.local",
    "bs.psk.key": "<64 hex>",
    "dm.psk.id":  "rpi100000abcd@cloud.local",
    "dm.psk.key": "<64 hex>"
  }]
cloud.dev.mode            → Commissioning flag. While true the ds-server
                            bypasses the PSK ACLs so cloud-httpd can write
                            the carrier + reveal creds. (gid:cloud-svc)
```

Device-side PSK keys (`iot.lua`, loaded by the same ds-server; client runs
as `engineer`):
```
iot.serial                → Hardware serial. RPi: auto-filled by the client
                            at startup; non-RPi: installer enters via
                            device-ui. = endpoint = BS PSK identity. (gid:engineer write)
iot.dev.mode              → Commissioning flag (bypasses PSK ACLs). (gid:engineer)
iot.bs.psk.identity       → = raw serial (on-the-wire BS identity). (gid:engineer rw)
iot.bs.psk.key            → BS PSK, hex. device-ui-generated, write-only. (gid:engineer rw)
iot.dm.psk.identity       → = rpi<serial>@cloud.local, from bootstrap. (gid:engineer rw)
iot.dm.psk.key            → DM PSK, hex, from bootstrap, write-only. (gid:engineer rw)
```
`gid:engineer`/`gid:cloud-svc` are unix groups (the static service accounts
the client / cloud servers run as) — not ds keys, so hyphens are allowed.

### Endpoints (written by iot-cloudd, read by cloud UI)

`EndpointRegistry` + `VpnRegistry` are in-memory, but iot-cloudd **rehydrates
them from ds at startup** (`rehydrate_registry`, before the first sync): it
exact-restores `tun_ip`/`proxy_port`/registered from the persisted
`cloud.endpoints`, and heals any provisioned endpoint in
`cloud.endpoint.credentials` that lacks a registry row. Without this the empty
registry would overwrite `cloud.endpoints` with `[]` on every restart — a
provisioned device would vanish from the table and lose its tun_ip/proxy_port.
PSKs are never touched (only the registry/allocations are rebuilt).

```
cloud.endpoints          → JSON array of provisioned endpoints
  [{
    "endpoint":      "urn:dev:gateway-42",
    "state":         "online",
    "tun_ip":        "10.9.0.12",
    "proxy_port":    10000,
    "registered":    true,
    "last_seen_unix": 1718123456
  }]
cloud.lwm2m.registrations → JSON array of currently-registered endpoints.
                            SOLE writer = lwm2m-dm (from its ClientRegistry on
                            Register/Update/Deregister + lifetime expiry).
                            iot-cloudd watches it and merges online/offline +
                            last_seen into cloud.endpoints (separate key avoids
                            a two-writer clobber on tun_ip/proxy_port).
  [{ "endpoint": "100000abcd", "registered": true, "last_seen_unix": 1718123456 }]
```

### VPN Server (cloud.vpn.*)
```
cloud.vpn.subnet         → Tunnel subnet (default 10.9.0.0/24); ds-only (no
                           VPN_SUBNET env/CLI — read live by iot-cloudd)
cloud.vpn.port.next      → Next proxy port (10000–10050)
cloud.vpn.ca.crt         → CA cert path
cloud.vpn.ca.key         → CA key path (secret volume)
cloud.vpn.server.crt     → Server cert path
cloud.vpn.server.key     → Server key path
```

### Services (services.cloud.*)
```
services.ds.state                           → ds-server state (default "stopped")
services.cloud.iot.cloudd.enable|state      → iot-cloudd enable/state
services.cloud.iot.httpd.enable|state       → iot-httpd enable/state
services.cloud.openvpn.server.enable|state  → openvpn-server enable/state
services.cloud.lwm2m.bs.state               → lwm2m-bs state (always-on, docker-compose managed)
services.cloud.lwm2m.dm.state               → lwm2m-dm state (always-on, docker-compose managed)
```
All state keys default to `"stopped"`. Each daemon self-reports `"running"`
immediately after connecting to ds-server, and `"exited"` at shutdown.
The Services page polls every 5s.
