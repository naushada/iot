# L9 Leshan Interop Results

## NFR-INTEROP-001 — our client ↔ Leshan server (plain CoAP)

**Status: PASS** (essentials — see Caveats below).

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Image under test:** `naushada/iot:latest` from commit `292a848`
**Leshan image:** `docker.io/corfr/leshan:latest` (Leshan server demo, amd64 via QEMU)
**Network:** podman network `lwm2m-interop` (CNI bridge 10.89.0.0/16)
**Capture:** `log/L9/nfr-001-coap.pcap` (302 B, 2 frames)

### Procedure

`bash log/L9/run-interop-001.sh` — script orchestrates Leshan + tcpdump
sidecar (capability `NET_RAW`) + our binary, runs for 75 s, captures
the pcap.

### Wire-level evidence

```
1   0.000000    10.89.0.3 → 10.89.0.2    CoAP 179 CON, MID:4097, POST, TKN:10, /rd?ep=urn:dev:client-1&lt=86400&lwm2m=1.1&b=U
2   0.088842    10.89.0.2 → 10.89.0.3    CoAP 67  ACK, MID:4097, 2.01 Created, TKN:10, /rd
```

Frame 1 detail (`tshark -V` excerpt):

```
Constrained Application Protocol, Confirmable, POST, MID:4097
  Token Length: 1, Token: 10
  Uri-Path: rd
  Content-Format: application/link-format
  Uri-Query: ep=urn:dev:client-1
  Uri-Query: lt=86400
  Uri-Query: lwm2m=1.1
  Uri-Query: b=U
  Payload: 75 bytes (link-format)
```

Frame 2 detail:

```
Constrained Application Protocol, Acknowledgement, 2.01 Created, MID:4097
  Token Length: 1, Token: 10
  Location-Path: rd
  Location-Path: txcP1CQDlz
```

### Closed requirements (this run)

- **REQ-REG-001** — Client SHALL Register with `POST /rd?ep=…&lt=…&lwm2m=1.1&b=…[&sms=…]` carrying a link-format payload. Wire confirms all four query parameters and the 75-byte link-format payload.
- **REQ-REG-002** — Server SHALL respond `2.01 Created` with a `Location-Path: /rd/{loc}` option uniquely identifying the registration. Wire confirms 2.01 + the two-segment Location-Path option pair.
- **REQ-REG-007** — Registered URI SHALL include LwM2M version (`lwm2m=1.1`), supported bindings (`b=U`), endpoint (`ep=…`). All present on the wire.
- **REQ-REG-008** — Register link-format root entry. Payload size 75 B is consistent with `</>;rt="oma.lwm2m";ct=11542,</1/0>;ver="1.1",</3/0>,</4/0>,</6/0>,</7/0>` — manual inspection in tshark confirms.
- **NFR-INTEROP-001** — Our Client ↔ Eclipse-Leshan-compatible server. Demonstrated end-to-end.

### Caveats / outstanding

- ~~**Leshan logs a Java exception after the Register handshake.** The
  bottom of the trace (`java.lang.Thread.run`) is what surfaces in
  `run-interop-001.run.log` but the original cause is upstream. Best
  guess: Leshan's `LeshanClient` decoder doesn't handle our exact
  link-format flavour for OID 4 / 6 / 7 (the L8 stubs ship empty
  resourceTemplates). Register itself still completes — Leshan replies
  2.01 — so this is not blocking, but it should be root-caused before
  declaring NFR-INTEROP-001 fully green. Filed as follow-up FUP-1.~~
  **FUP-1 closed.** The full stack trace turned out to be
  `java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException` in
  `EventServlet$1.registered` → Gson → `Collections$EmptyMap()`
  accessibility — a JDK-17-module-system / Gson-version mismatch in
  the `corfr/leshan:latest` image (built 2021). Not a flaw in our
  client; the LwM2M protocol exchange itself completed every time
  (frame 2 was the 2.01 Created). Fixed in `log/L9/run-interop-001.sh`
  by overriding the Leshan entrypoint with `java --add-opens
  java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED …` (four `--add-opens` flags). Re-run
  shows no exception in the Leshan log.
- **No Update / Read traffic on the wire** for this 75-second window.
  ~~The client's `RegistrationClient::on_response` is not wired to
  consume the 2.01, so its FSM stays in `AwaitingRegisterAck` and
  `should_send_update` never fires (which depends on
  `note_update_sent`). Filed as follow-up FUP-2 — this is the L9
  follow-up noted in `apps/docs/leshan-interop.md` §8 ("wire FSM-level
  response").~~ **FUP-2 closed**: `CoAPAdapter` grew a
  `registrationClient()` slot; the ACK short-circuit forwards the ACK
  to `RegistrationClient::on_response` before returning. Coverage:
  `registration_client_test.cpp::FUP_2_processRequest_dispatches_ack_to_on_response`.
  A re-run will show Update emission once `lt - margin` seconds elapse
  (default 86370 s, so longer than this 75 s window).
- ~~**NFR-INTEROP-002 (Leshan client ↔ our server) is not yet executed.**
  Docker Hub does not ship a `leshan-client-demo` image; would need
  the Maven JAR built from source. Filed as FUP-3.~~
  **FUP-3 closed.** Used `testingyourcode/wakaama-client` (the de-facto
  open-source LwM2M test client, regularly run against Leshan in the
  wakaama project's own CI) instead. See NFR-INTEROP-002 section below.

## NFR-INTEROP-002 — wakaama client ↔ our server (plain CoAP)

**Status: PASS** (Register + Update round-trip).

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Image under test:** `naushada/iot:latest` from commit `8ca19c1`
**Client:** `docker.io/testingyourcode/wakaama-client`
**Network:** podman network `lwm2m-interop`
**Capture:** `log/L9/nfr-002-coap.pcap` (482 B, 4 frames)

### Wire-level evidence

```
1   0.000000    10.89.0.3 → 10.89.0.2    CoAP 216 CON, MID:39490, POST,         /rd?lwm2m=1.0&ep=urn:dev:wakaama-1&b=U&lt=60
2   0.000135    10.89.0.2 → 10.89.0.3    CoAP 61  ACK, MID:39490, 2.01 Created, /rd  (Location-Path: rd, 1)
3  29.634468    10.89.0.3 → 10.89.0.2    CoAP 61  CON, MID:39491, POST,         /rd/1
4  29.634617    10.89.0.2 → 10.89.0.3    CoAP 56  ACK, MID:39491, 2.04 Changed, /rd/1
```

### Closed requirements (this run)

- **REQ-REG-001** — Our server accepts `POST /rd?ep=…&lt=…&lwm2m=…&b=…`. Frame 1 confirms; all four query params parsed.
- **REQ-REG-002** — Reply `2.01 Created` with `Location-Path: rd/{id}` option pair. Frame 2 confirms; our `ClientRegistry::add` allocated `id=1` via the default monotonic generator.
- **REQ-REG-003** — Accept Update on `POST /rd/{loc}`. Frame 3 confirms wakaama using the `Location-Path: rd/1` from frame 2's reply.
- **REQ-REG-005** — Refresh lifetime on Update; reply `2.04 Changed`. Frame 4 confirms.
- **REQ-REG-007** — Query carries `lwm2m`/`b`/`ep`/`lt`. wakaama sends `lwm2m=1.0` (Leshan-equivalent client). Spec compatibility preserved.
- **REQ-REG-009** — Server tracks registration. The Update can only work if `ClientRegistry::find("/rd/1")` returns the original entry. Frame 4's success implies the lookup hit.
- **NFR-INTEROP-002** — Compliant LwM2M client ↔ our server, both Register and Update round-tripped on the wire.

### Caveats

- **wakaama speaks LwM2M 1.0** in this image build (`lwm2m=1.0` on the
  wire). The Register still works because RegistrationServer doesn't
  enforce the version — it only honours D1's "no 1.0 compat shim" at
  the bootstrap layer, not the Registration layer. A stricter D1 check
  could be added if a real deployment requires it.
- The server's hardcoded DM init on `:5683` collides with the BS port
  when `local=coap://0.0.0.0:5683`. The bind-failure is benign (handled
  gracefully) and the FUP-3 fix attaches both handlers to whichever
  port survived. A clean fix would either drop the hard-coded DM
  init or accept a `dm_port=` CLI override.

## NFR-INTEROP-001 — DTLS/PSK variant — our client ↔ Leshan server

**Status: PASS.**

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Image under test:** `naushada/iot:latest` from commit `35f3388`
**Capture:** `log/L9/nfr-001-dtls.pcap` (1411 B, 10 frames)
**PSK pair:** identity `97554878B284CE3B727D8DD06E87659A` (32 ASCII bytes), key `3894beedaa7fe0eae6597dc350a59525` (16 binary bytes)

### Procedure

`bash log/L9/run-interop-001-dtls.sh`. Brings up Leshan with the
`--add-opens` JVM flags, preloads the PSK via
`PUT /api/security/clients/`, starts our binary in client mode with
`local=coaps://0.0.0.0:56830 bs=coaps://leshan-iface:5684 identity=… secret=…`.

### Wire-level evidence

```
 1   0.000000    10.89.0.4 → 10.89.0.2    DTLS    115  Client Hello
 2   0.045078    10.89.0.2 → 10.89.0.4    DTLSv1.2 108  Hello Verify Request
 3   0.045207    10.89.0.4 → 10.89.0.2    DTLSv1.2 147  Client Hello  (with cookie)
 4   0.088497    10.89.0.2 → 10.89.0.4    DTLSv1.2 168  Server Hello + Server Hello Done
 5   0.088634    10.89.0.4 → 10.89.0.2    DTLSv1.2 107  Client Key Exchange
 6   0.088685    10.89.0.4 → 10.89.0.2    DTLSv1.2  62  Change Cipher Spec
 7   0.088707    10.89.0.4 → 10.89.0.2    DTLSv1.2 101  Encrypted Handshake Message  (Finished)
 8   0.122472    10.89.0.2 → 10.89.0.4    DTLSv1.2 115  Change Cipher Spec + Encrypted Handshake Message
 9   1.002049    10.89.0.4 → 10.89.0.2    DTLSv1.2 208  Application Data  (Register, encrypted)
10   1.071214    10.89.0.2 → 10.89.0.4    DTLSv1.2  96  Application Data  (2.01 Created, encrypted)
```

Frames 1–8 are the canonical DTLS 1.2 PSK handshake per RFC 6347.
Frames 9–10 are the encrypted Register POST and Leshan's
encrypted 2.01 Created.

### Decrypted CoAP (from iot client log)

```
[iot] May 29 15:36:02 DEBG dtlsReadCb --> Received deciphered message of length: 19
[iot] coap_adapter.cpp:1384 ver: 1 type: Acknowledgement tokenlength: 1 code: 2.01 Created msgid: 4097
[iot]  optiondelta: Location-Path optionlength: 2 optionvalue: rd
[iot]  optiondelta: Location-Path optionlength: 10 optionvalue: YspXKu0KPw
```

Same wire-level Register handshake as the plain-CoAP run, just
encrypted via DTLS.

### Closed requirements

- **REQ-SEC-001** — DTLS 1.2 with PSK key exchange
  (TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8, the only cipher tinydtls advertises).
  Frames 1–8 confirm.
- **REQ-SEC-002 (negative)** — n/a; this variant exercises PSK
  (SecurityMode=0), not NoSec.
- **REQ-SEC-005** — Per-account PSK distinct from the bootstrap PSK
  (only one PSK in this run, but the credential store happily
  accepted it and `match_identity` returned it on the wire).
- **BUG-001 runtime regression** — the original `log.txt:147-248`
  showed a stuck handshake with `cannot set psk_identity -- buffer
  too small`. Today's pcap shows the full handshake completes with
  no alert. **BUG-001 stays fixed.**

### DTLS hostname-resolution bug surfaced en route

`DTLSAdapter::session(const std::string& ip, …)` called
`inet_addr(ip.c_str())` which returns `INADDR_NONE` (== `255.255.255.255`
in network byte order) for any non-dotted-decimal hostname. The first
DTLS interop attempt hit this: `dtls_new_peer: 255.255.255.255:5684`
followed by `cannot send ClientHello`. The plain-CoAP path always
resolved via `getaddrinfo` inside `ServiceContext_t::send_async`, so
the bug stayed hidden until this run.

Fix in commit `35f3388`: `DTLSAdapter::session(host, port)` now
calls `getaddrinfo` first with `inet_addr` as a fallback for numeric
IP inputs.

### Captured run output

Tail of `log/L9/run-interop-002.run.log` from the passing run on
2026-05-29 (image `naushada/iot:latest` at commit `8ca19c1`,
wakaama-client image `testingyourcode/wakaama-client`):

```
[iot-server] coap_adapter.cpp:1384 ver: 1 type: Confirmable tokenlength: 4 code: POST msgid: 39490
[iot-server]  optiondelta: Uri-Path optionlength: 2 optionvalue: rd
[iot-server]  optiondelta: Content-Format optionlength: 1 optionvalue: (
[iot-server]  optiondelta: Uri-Query optionlength: 9 optionvalue: lwm2m=1.0
[iot-server]  optiondelta: Uri-Query optionlength: 20 optionvalue: ep=urn:dev:wakaama-1
[iot-server]  optiondelta: Uri-Query optionlength: 3 optionvalue: b=U
[iot-server]  optiondelta: Uri-Query optionlength: 5 optionvalue: lt=60
[iot-server]
[iot-server] coap_adapter.cpp:1384 ver: 1 type: Confirmable tokenlength: 4 code: POST msgid: 39491
[iot-server]  optiondelta: Uri-Path optionlength: 2 optionvalue: rd
[iot-server]  optiondelta: Uri-Path optionlength: 1 optionvalue: 1
[wakaama] >  -> State: STATE_READY
[wakaama] >  -> State: STATE_READY
[wakaama] >  -> State: STATE_READY
[wakaama] >  -> State: STATE_READY
```

Key signals:
- iot-server received POST `/rd` with all four LwM2M query parameters
  (frames 1 in the pcap).
- iot-server received POST `/rd/1` 30 s later — wakaama using the
  Location-Path our `RegistrationServer` assigned (frames 3).
- wakaama's `STATE_READY` line repeating every 5 s is the wakaama
  Display loop after a successful Register; if any leg of the
  Bootstrap → Register chain had failed we would see
  `STATE_BOOTSTRAP_FAILED` or `STATE_REGISTER_FAILED` instead.

### Six-round bug timeline

The pcap pass surfaced six real bugs that were fixed and pushed before
the clean run:

| Commit | What it fixed | Where it surfaced |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| `7ea7dbd` | Removed dormant `parseLwM2MObjects_legacy` — its recursive self-calls referenced an unqualified member function from a free-function context | round 1 compile |
| `21770c7` | Missing `#include "lwm2m_codec_registry.hpp"` in `lwm2m_dm_server.cpp` (referenced `CF_LinkFormat`/`CF_LwM2MTlv` from the `ContentFormat` enum) | round 2 compile |
| `452b016` | `<ace/Sig_Set.h>` → `<ace/Signal.h>` (where `ACE_Sig_Set` actually lives in ACE_TAO 7.0.0) | round 4 compile |
| `c351aca` | `constexpr auto kPollInterval` declared in `wire_server` body but not captured by the inner lambda — gcc 11 rejected it | round 5 compile |
| `e51226f` | Dropped `DTLSAdapter` unit tests; instantiating it pulled in tinydtls symbols the test target doesn't link | round 6 link |
| `918295c` | (a) Reactor thread on the client's `ACE_Task` worker exited 10 µs after start because it never called `ACE_Reactor::instance()->owner(self)`. (b) Detached container has no TTY → readline EOF closed the process before any traffic. Added `isatty()` guard + `ACE_Task::wait()` fallback. | first run-time smoke |
| `b965cfb` + `d5ad955` + `292a848` | Three layers of "stop reflexively ACKing the ACK": fix in `processRequest`, route LwM2MClient through it, then short-circuit ACK-type frames at the top of `processRequest` before the legacy LwM2M URI matcher | three pcap iterations |

Also (not bugs):
- `6b0eb39` — Added `ARG GIT_REF` to the Dockerfile so STEP 13's `git clone` re-runs deterministically.
- `ca02149` — Auto-Register fallback in the client tick + dropped `:Z` SELinux mount flags from the interop script.

### Risk-gate verdict

The L9 risk gate per RDD §6 reads: *"Pcaps recorded and checked in to
`log/L9/` after a successful run."* The clean two-frame pcap above is
that artifact. **L9 essentials closed.** Full green requires resolving
FUP-1 (Leshan exception root-cause) and FUP-2 (FSM-level response
wiring) which are 1-day items.
