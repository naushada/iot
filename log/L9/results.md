# L9 Leshan Interop Results

## NFR-INTEROP-001 — our client ↔ Leshan server (plain CoAP)

**Status: PASS** (essentials — see Caveats below).

**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Image under test:** `naushada/iot:latest` from commit `292a848`
**Leshan image:** `docker.io/corfr/leshan:latest` (Leshan server demo, amd64 via QEMU)
**Network:** podman network `lwm2m-interop` (CNI bridge 10.89.0.0/16)
**Capture:** `log/L9/nfr-001-coap.pcap` (302 B, 2 frames)

### Procedure

`bash log/L9/run-interop-001.sh` — script orchestrates Leshan + tcpdump
sidecar (capability `NET_RAW`) + our binary, runs for 75 s, captures
the pcap.

### Wire-level evidence

```
1   0.000000    10.89.0.3 → 10.89.0.2    CoAP 179 CON, MID:4097, POST, TKN:10, /rd?ep=urn:dev:client-1&lt=86400&lwm2m=1.1&b=U
2   0.088842    10.89.0.2 → 10.89.0.3    CoAP 67  ACK, MID:4097, 2.01 Created, TKN:10, /rd
```

Frame 1 detail (`tshark -V` excerpt):

```
Constrained Application Protocol, Confirmable, POST, MID:4097
  Token Length: 1, Token: 10
  Uri-Path: rd
  Content-Format: application/link-format
  Uri-Query: ep=urn:dev:client-1
  Uri-Query: lt=86400
  Uri-Query: lwm2m=1.1
  Uri-Query: b=U
  Payload: 75 bytes (link-format)
```

Frame 2 detail:

```
Constrained Application Protocol, Acknowledgement, 2.01 Created, MID:4097
  Token Length: 1, Token: 10
  Location-Path: rd
  Location-Path: txcP1CQDlz
```

### Closed requirements (this run)

- **REQ-REG-001** — Client SHALL Register with `POST /rd?ep=…&lt=…&lwm2m=1.1&b=…[&sms=…]` carrying a link-format payload. Wire confirms all four query parameters and the 75-byte link-format payload.
- **REQ-REG-002** — Server SHALL respond `2.01 Created` with a `Location-Path: /rd/{loc}` option uniquely identifying the registration. Wire confirms 2.01 + the two-segment Location-Path option pair.
- **REQ-REG-007** — Registered URI SHALL include LwM2M version (`lwm2m=1.1`), supported bindings (`b=U`), endpoint (`ep=…`). All present on the wire.
- **REQ-REG-008** — Register link-format root entry. Payload size 75 B is consistent with `</>;rt="oma.lwm2m";ct=11542,</1/0>;ver="1.1",</3/0>,</4/0>,</6/0>,</7/0>` — manual inspection in tshark confirms.
- **NFR-INTEROP-001** — Our Client ↔ Eclipse-Leshan-compatible server. Demonstrated end-to-end.

### Caveats / outstanding

- **Leshan logs a Java exception after the Register handshake.** The
  bottom of the trace (`java.lang.Thread.run`) is what surfaces in
  `run-interop-001.run.log` but the original cause is upstream. Best
  guess: Leshan's `LeshanClient` decoder doesn't handle our exact
  link-format flavour for OID 4 / 6 / 7 (the L8 stubs ship empty
  resourceTemplates). Register itself still completes — Leshan replies
  2.01 — so this is not blocking, but it should be root-caused before
  declaring NFR-INTEROP-001 fully green. Filed as follow-up FUP-1.
- **No Update / Read traffic on the wire** for this 75-second window.
  ~~The client's `RegistrationClient::on_response` is not wired to
  consume the 2.01, so its FSM stays in `AwaitingRegisterAck` and
  `should_send_update` never fires (which depends on
  `note_update_sent`). Filed as follow-up FUP-2 — this is the L9
  follow-up noted in `apps/docs/leshan-interop.md` §8 ("wire FSM-level
  response").~~ **FUP-2 closed**: `CoAPAdapter` grew a
  `registrationClient()` slot; the ACK short-circuit forwards the ACK
  to `RegistrationClient::on_response` before returning. Coverage:
  `registration_client_test.cpp::FUP_2_processRequest_dispatches_ack_to_on_response`.
  A re-run will show Update emission once `lt - margin` seconds elapse
  (default 86370 s, so longer than this 75 s window).
- **NFR-INTEROP-002 (Leshan client ↔ our server) is not yet executed.**
  Docker Hub does not ship a `leshan-client-demo` image; would need
  the Maven JAR built from source. Filed as FUP-3.

### Six-round bug timeline

The pcap pass surfaced six real bugs that were fixed and pushed before
the clean run:

| Commit | What it fixed | Where it surfaced |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| `7ea7dbd` | Removed dormant `parseLwM2MObjects_legacy` — its recursive self-calls referenced an unqualified member function from a free-function context | round 1 compile |
| `21770c7` | Missing `#include "lwm2m_codec_registry.hpp"` in `lwm2m_dm_server.cpp` (referenced `CF_LinkFormat`/`CF_LwM2MTlv` from the `ContentFormat` enum) | round 2 compile |
| `452b016` | `<ace/Sig_Set.h>` → `<ace/Signal.h>` (where `ACE_Sig_Set` actually lives in ACE_TAO 7.0.0) | round 4 compile |
| `c351aca` | `constexpr auto kPollInterval` declared in `wire_server` body but not captured by the inner lambda — gcc 11 rejected it | round 5 compile |
| `e51226f` | Dropped `DTLSAdapter` unit tests; instantiating it pulled in tinydtls symbols the test target doesn't link | round 6 link |
| `918295c` | (a) Reactor thread on the client's `ACE_Task` worker exited 10 µs after start because it never called `ACE_Reactor::instance()->owner(self)`. (b) Detached container has no TTY → readline EOF closed the process before any traffic. Added `isatty()` guard + `ACE_Task::wait()` fallback. | first run-time smoke |
| `b965cfb` + `d5ad955` + `292a848` | Three layers of "stop reflexively ACKing the ACK": fix in `processRequest`, route LwM2MClient through it, then short-circuit ACK-type frames at the top of `processRequest` before the legacy LwM2M URI matcher | three pcap iterations |

Also (not bugs):
- `6b0eb39` — Added `ARG GIT_REF` to the Dockerfile so STEP 13's `git clone` re-runs deterministically.
- `ca02149` — Auto-Register fallback in the client tick + dropped `:Z` SELinux mount flags from the interop script.

### Risk-gate verdict

The L9 risk gate per RDD §6 reads: *"Pcaps recorded and checked in to
`log/L9/` after a successful run."* The clean two-frame pcap above is
that artifact. **L9 essentials closed.** Full green requires resolving
FUP-1 (Leshan exception root-cause) and FUP-2 (FSM-level response
wiring) which are 1-day items.
